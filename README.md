## 🎬 New Features Added! 10 May 2025

This updated turtle race project includes the following enhancements:

- 🎯 **Tie Detection**: When multiple turtles cross the finish line in the same round, it's recognized as a draw. If your bet is among the winners, you still win!
- 🌈 **Winning Message in Color**: The winning message appears in the same color as the turtle you bet on.
- 🧨 **Start Animation**: "Ready... Set... Go!" is shown on the screen before the race begins.
- 🔊 **Sound Effects**:
  - A start sound plays when the race begins.
  - A cheering sound for a win or draw.
  - A sad sound if your turtle loses.

> Try placing your bet and enjoy the excitement! 🐢🎉


# 🐢 Turtle Race Game

A colorful turtle race game built using Python's built-in `turtle` module.  
The user places a bet on a turtle color and watches the race unfold — will your turtle win?

---

## 🎮 How to Play

1. When the game starts, you will be prompted to place a bet by choosing a turtle color.
2. The turtles move forward randomly.
3. The first turtle to cross the finish line (x = 230) is declared the winner.
4. If your turtle wins, you'll see: “You’ve won!” — otherwise, “You’ve lost.”
5. In case of a **tie**, all winning turtles are listed. If your bet is among them, you win!
